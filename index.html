              <p>Prior to joining Epicodus I was in the coffee industry. Five years ago I started as Barista at <em>Caffe Medici</em> in Austin, Texas. I quickly moved around in different roles for the company. I even competed in a Barista Competition. I fell into the role of their in house technican. I began to work on their brewers and espresso machines. I was working crazy hours and had another Cafe reached out offering a better schedule. I moved to <em>Houndstooth</em>, where I managed all their espresso machines, brewers, and water filtration for all of their locations in Austin and Dallas Texas. In 2016 I left Austin,TX to move to Seattle,WA. I began working at <em>Visions Espresso</em> where I was Field Service Technician. I was working on espresso machines and brewers. I worked on 20+ diffent manufactures. As I approached a year with Visions, I began to feel bored. I wanted to learn and continue to grow but I was hitting a wall. Visions offered me a managment position. I declined position and I began to look at other carrer paths. I had a few friends who were web developers. So I explored, played with turtorials online. I really enjoyed the trouble-shooting aspect and I was intrigued by tech companies that are making our lives easier. After 8 months of working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I decided to immerse myself and I chose Epicodus.</p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello! I am Austin from Austin, Texas. I am an odd breed of outdoorsmen/city-dweller. In my spare time I enjoy exploring Seattle and the mountains around the city. Most weekends I will be bouldering in Squamish, Index, Gold Bar, or Levenworth. If I am not climbing, I will be hiking to an Alpine lake. When it rains, I will be hanging around Seattle. I go to coffee shops and find new restaurants.</p>
